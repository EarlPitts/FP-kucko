# Mocking

- OOP tecnique
- Behaviour testing:
    - Function calls happen in right order with right parameters
- Biggest problem: tightly coupled to implementation:
    - E.g.: optimization can change what functions are called
    - You have to rewrite your tests
- Mocking libs use a lot of reflection and metaprogramming:
    - We try to avoid that that in FP

# The FP Solution

## Separation of data and operations

## Parametric polymorphism

## Higher-order functions

## Lightweight Interpreters

- Decoupling:
    - Logic is decoupled from their interpreters/effects


# YAGNI is an anti-pattern

- Limits thinking
